# Week 4.0 Lab Activity: Kanban Task Management Web App

## Learning Objectives
- **Angular Mastery:** Solidify skills in building complex Angular applications, including component structuring, data binding, and routing.
- **NgRx Expertise:** Gain proficiency in using NgRx for state management, including defining actions, reducers, effects, and selectors.
- **RxJS Fluency:** Utilize RxJS operators to handle asynchronous operations, manage data streams, and streamline application logic.

## Introduction
This project challenges you to develop a feature-rich task management application using Angular as the framework, along with NgRx for state management and RxJS for handling asynchronous operations and data streams. Your goal is to replicate the provided design as closely as possible while ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

You will work with a local `data.json` file to populate initial content, and you're encouraged to explore building a full-stack application if you'd like to take on an additional challenge.

## Core Features & Evaluation

### 1. Responsive Layout
- **Description:** The app layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Grading:**
  - Excellent (20 points): Flawless responsiveness across all devices.
  - Good (15 points): Minor layout adjustments needed on some devices.
  - Fair (10 points): Functional on some sizes, but improvements are needed.
  - Poor (5 points): Not responsive, causing display issues.
